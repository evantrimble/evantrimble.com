This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the lovely [Ananke] (https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme. As a technically fluent non-developer, Hugo has been remarkably easy to use and I was reminded that the hardest parts of many projects aren't technical. In this case, deciding on the site sections and content, including finding and preparing images took longer than (re)learning some Terminal commands, installing [Homebrew] (https://brew.sh/) and Hugo, and setting things up at [Digital Ocean] (https://m.do.co/c/b5faf4a66af6). As someone who last built a website totally solo sometime when CSS was still new, it's been delightful to dig into it again and dabble with some of the great tools folks have created.
