Besides cooking and meditation, I like to take pictures (the photographs on here are mine), read—primarily dharma, business leadership, and biographies—and I've just started doing yoga, after many years of a strongly-held dislike of stretching. I occasionally watch movies or sports, both of which I love, and make flower arrangements, more or less in the traditions of [Kalapa Ikebana] (https://shambhalatimes.org/tag/kalapa-ikebana/) and the [Sogetsu School] (http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/) of [Ikebana] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikebana).

As a student of [Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche] (https://www.sakyong.com/), I am committed to helping to create good human society. I endeavor to hold this view in all of my life, from how I relate to my partner and my home to how I engage in school, the workplace, and beyond. I'm a meditation teacher in the [Shambhala] (https://shambhala.org/) tradition, and also regular volunteer.

### A mini history via the places I've lived longest:

_Bloomington, Indiana._ I came to Bloomington in 2016 to go to business school at [Kelley] (https://kelley.iu.edu/), supported
by my partner, [Kaylen] (http://www.nortso.com/). As I write this, I'm a few months from graduation, after which I'm joining [Eaton] (http://www.eaton.com/us/en-us.html) in their Global Leadership Development Program, a 2 year general management leadership development program. I'm excited to go work for an industrial/commercial manufacturer. Ever since I was Operations Manager for a wine import & wholesale company, I've been especially curious about manufacturing.

_Austin, Texas._ Two years of heat and sun was about enough for me, but I lived in Austin for 3 more years after those first two, pulled by vibrant meditation and mindfulness communities (the [Austin Shambhala Center] (https://austin.shambhala.org/) and the [Young Meditators' Group] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/YMGAustin/), which I co-founded), great music venues and movie theaters, excellent tacos, and good friends, including one of the best teams I've ever worked with at [Bazaarvoice] (http://www.bazaarvoice.com/), where I had a somewhat too cushy job as a Lead Solutions Architect.

_Portland, Oregon._ I came to Portland <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/EY3Q9QNU10h1K" width="480" height="221" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p> to attend [Reed](https://www.reed.edu) and stayed to work in the wine business. At Reed, I majored in French, writing a thesis on Proust (fascinating but over-ambitious for an undergraduate thesis) under the guidance of Luc Monin. The work I'm most proud of at Reed was a paper I wrote on what metaphors mean for [Robert Knapp's] (http://people.reed.edu/~knapp/) class _Thinking Through Literature_.

The fall after graduation, I worked a harvest under Eric [Hamacher](http://www.hamacherwines.com/) and Grant Coulter (now of [Hundred Suns Wine](http://hundredsunswine.com/) and [Flaneur Wines](https://www.flaneurwines.com)), helping to make wines for Eric's own label, as well as three others. Earlier that summer, I'd sent letters to four importers/wholesalers I wanted to work for. All four responded, which as a recent grad was so touching, inspiring, and exciting (thank you Dieter Klippstein, Ewald [Moseler](http://www.moseler.com/), Don Heistuman, and Bob Liner). I went to Triage Wines, then an importer/wholesaler in Oregon and Washington. After a year as Warehouse Manager in Portland, I moved up to "senior mgmt.", running wholesale operations in both states, international logistics, and some of the purchasing as well.

_Vancouver, Canada._ Born and raised, in Vancouver, the mountains and ocean will always be part of my heart. I've lived in many parts of the city, but have a special love for walking Commercial Drive and Spanish Banks. I went to high-school at [Point Grey Mini School] (https://pgmini.org/) and elementary (French immersion) at [Lord Tennyson] (http://www.lordtennyson.ca/).
